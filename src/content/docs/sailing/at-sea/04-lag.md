# Mooring Alongside a Dock (Lag)

Mooring alongside a dock (also known as "lag mooring") is a common procedure in tidal regions, particularly at marine fuel stations and guest berths. This guide will walk you through the process step by step, including some useful tips for both beginners and experienced sailors.

## Overview

The basic process of mooring alongside consists of three main steps:
1. Yacht approaches the dock at an acute angle
2. The bow turns away from the dock
3. The yacht stops parallel to the dock
4. The crew secures the yacht to the dock

While it sounds simple, let's break down each step in detail.

## Preparation Phase

### Selecting the Mooring Location
- Choose an appropriate spot along the dock
- Check the dock height
- Look for potential obstacles (protruding fittings, other boats' mooring lines)

### Setting Up Fenders
- Adjust fenders to match dock height
- Place one large round fender at the bow
- Position second large round fender near the stern
- Distribute remaining fenders evenly from the center of the yacht

### Preparing Mooring Lines
1. Start with the stern line (most important)
2. Prepare the bow line
3. Route lines around all stanchions
4. Carefully lay lines along the deck (prevent them from falling into water or wrapping around propeller)

### Crew Briefing
- Explain the intended mooring location
- Emphasize that crew should only disembark on command
- Demonstrate proper disembarking technique:
  - For high docks: face forward
  - For low docks: back first while holding onto rails
- Show how to secure lines to different types of cleats
- Assign one crew member to indicate distance from dock

## Approach Technique

### Basic Physics
- The yacht rotates around its center of rotation (approximately near the mast)
- The yacht cannot stop instantly
- Approach speed depends on:
  - Wind direction and speed
  - Yacht displacement
  - Propeller configuration
- Use minimum speed while maintaining control

### Standard Approach
1. Choose an aiming point 3-4 meters ahead of intended final bow position
2. Approach at minimum controllable speed
3. When 2 meters from dock: turn helm 20 degrees
4. At 1 meter: turn helm additional 120 degrees
5. Immediately engage reverse at medium RPM (around 1700)
6. Once parallel to dock, center the helm
7. Stop the yacht completely
8. Shift to neutral

## Securing the Yacht

### Line Sequence
1. Secure stern line first
2. Turn helm away from dock and engage forward gear (this helps press the stern against dock)
3. Secure bow line
4. Add spring lines:
   - Forward spring prevents backward movement
   - Aft spring prevents forward movement

### Important Tips
- Don't over-tighten mooring lines
- Allow some slack for wave movement
- If dock lacks sufficient cleats, create a temporary line system along the dock

## Special Wind Conditions

### Onshore Wind
- Wind will push yacht toward dock
- Adjust aiming point to final bow position
- Maintain minimum controllable speed
- Position yacht parallel to dock
- Engage reverse to stop
- Let wind push yacht to dock
- Secure lines as normal

### Offshore Wind
This is the most challenging condition. Here's a simplified approach:
1. Approach stern-first against the wind
2. Stop one step from dock
3. Secure stern line
4. Turn helm away from dock
5. Engage forward gear to press yacht against dock
6. Secure remaining lines

### Strong Offshore Wind Tips
- Use spring line technique for better control
- Route spring line through stern
- Approach stern-first
- Use higher RPM to maintain control

## Departing from Dock

### Wind Considerations
- Offshore wind: Simply release lines and let wind push yacht off
- Onshore wind: Requires special technique

### Onshore Wind Departure
1. Place large fender at bow
2. Engage forward gear while maintaining stern line
3. Remove spring lines (stern first, then bow)
4. Convert bow line to spring line
5. Release stern line
6. Allow bow to press against fender
7. Turn helm toward dock
8. Wait for 6-degree angle from dock
9. Center helm and release spring line
10. Engage reverse to clear dock

## Safety Reminders
- Always maintain proper fender position
- Monitor lines for chafe
- Keep clear communication with crew
- Adjust technique based on wind and current conditions
- Practice in calm conditions before attempting in challenging weather

Remember that mastering alongside mooring takes practice. Start in calm conditions and gradually work up to more challenging situations as your confidence grows.
