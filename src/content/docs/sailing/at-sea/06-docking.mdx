## Introduction

A tight marina, strong wind, and a yacht that handles like a pregnant hippopotamus - this is the worst nightmare of any beginning skipper. It may seem that squeezing into a narrow space between two yachts is a task worthy of jewelers. While docking does require certain skills, success lies in understanding the factors that influence yacht behavior during movement and skillfully using these factors to your advantage - making them allies rather than enemies.

## Key Factors Affecting Yacht Behavior

### Pivot Point

The most important thing to always remember is the yacht's pivot point. This is the vertical line around which the yacht rotates when turning. For most modern yachts, the pivot point passes through the center of the keel, approximately one meter from the mast toward the stern. Therefore, when maneuvering around obstacles, turn the wheel when the mast aligns with the outermost point of the obstacle.

### Propeller System

The propeller is our propulsion system for docking. It's important to know which type your yacht has - a sail drive or a shaft drive. Sail drives work more efficiently because the propeller's axis of rotation is horizontal, resulting in faster acceleration and deceleration. Yachts with sail drives also experience less propeller kick.

#### Propeller Kick Effect

The propeller kick effect is most prominent when the propeller works in reverse. Depending on the direction of propeller rotation (clockwise or counterclockwise), the stern of the yacht is pulled to the side - either right or left. This effect is also called stern kick.

The first reason for this is that the upper and lower edges of the propeller are at different depths and therefore experience different water pressure. The lower blade pushes off the water more strongly.

As it rotates, the propeller draws water flows behind it, creating a horizontal vortex. The underwater part of the hull above the propeller interferes with the transverse movement of the upper part of the vortex, while the lower part is unobstructed. This creates a reactive effect that also pushes the stern sideways.

The further the propeller is from the false keel (the yacht's pivot point), the stronger the stern kick - simply because there's a longer leverage arm. The saildrive system takes up less space, allowing the propeller to be positioned closer to the hull, which is why shaft drive yachts generally experience stronger stern kick effects.

### Rudder

The rudder is the main means of controlling the yacht. It only works when there's water flow, either from forward motion or when the propeller is working in forward direction and sending water flow to the rudder.

If the yacht has a single rudder positioned in the center, you can turn the yacht even while stationary. To do this, you turn the rudder and engage forward gear - the propeller throws water flow toward the stern, this flow hits the rudder and pushes the stern sideways.

For this reason, it's better to enter any unfamiliar or suspicious area stern-first. If something goes wrong, simply increasing forward throttle will make the yacht immediately responsive, allowing you to easily escape from tight situations.

This won't work on yachts with two rudders, as the water flow from the propeller simply passes between the rudders. Such yachts need to gain some speed first to become maneuverable.

When the propeller works in reverse, it throws water toward the bow. If the yacht doesn't have momentum relative to the water, the rudder won't work since no water flows over it in this case.

## Wind Effects

After losing momentum, a modern yacht always tends to turn beam-to-wind, after which it drifts with the wind. The yacht veers most strongly when positioned with the bow against the wind. Never stop with the bow against the wind in a confined space.

It's best to accelerate for docking from a position with the stern against the wind. If there's no room to turn around in the marina, turn and gain momentum outside, then enter the marina stern-first.

## Mooring Equipment

Let's look at how a yacht attaches to a dock:

- **Bow lines (Moorings)**: These are ropes that pull the yacht away from the dock at the bow end. The mooring is attached to a chain, which connects to a large concrete block on the bottom.
- **Dock lines**: These prevent the yacht from moving away from the dock.

On the yacht, we secure dock lines to cleats and rings. Onshore, there may be various devices such as cleats, rings, or bollards.

Before departure, it's important to determine the wind direction and understand which side of the yacht is windward (the side from which the wind blows) and which is leeward (the opposite side).

## Departing from a Dock

### Preparation

Any yacht voyage begins with casting off. Casting off begins with briefing the crew:

1. Distribute the crew to their positions
2. Send one person to the bow - this will be the bow crew member
3. If there are extra hands, ask someone to stand with a fender at the leeward corner of the stern

We'll be exiting to the right. Remember that the boat rotates around its pivot point - the bow goes right, and the stern swings left, creating a risk of hitting the neighboring yacht with the stern corner.

Never push off from other yachts with your hands or feet. Fiberglass is much cheaper to repair than arms and legs.

For departure, we recommend using a method with gradual loosening of dock lines. This moves the yacht away from the dock and reduces the time needed for exit - the wind doesn't have time to blow the yacht sideways while we're departing.

### Step-by-Step Departure Procedure

1. Check that there are no lines near the propeller
2. Start the engine and engage forward gear (throttle depends on wind strength - minimal in light winds, more in strong winds to keep the boat steady)
3. The helmsman instructs the bow crew to release the mooring lines
4. The bow crew releases the moorings, starting with the leeward side
5. They throw them away from the yacht, ensure the moorings sink and won't interfere with departure
6. They then release the windward mooring, throw it away, and report "windward clear"

For crews of three or more, the bow crew should stay at the bow to:
- Monitor the situation ahead if another yacht is entering or leaving
- In tight marinas, indicate distances from our bow to the opposite row (using hand signals for 5 meters, 4, 3, etc.)

In the cockpit, crew members prepare the dock lines for release by laying them along the side of the boat. This is essential to prevent knots from forming and getting stuck in the fairlead or onshore.

### Common Departure Mistakes

1. Not accounting for wind speed and direction
2. Not laying dock lines along the side of the boat (which can lead to knots)
3. Not retrieving dock lines from the water (risking them getting caught in the propeller)
4. Not ensuring moorings have sunk (also risking propeller entanglement)

## Docking Procedure

In filled marinas, yachts are most often docked stern-to at the dock. This saves space and provides convenient access to shore.

### Preparation and Practice

Before docking, it's essential to study the yacht's behavior in reverse and learn to control it confidently. The correct position at the helm is crucial - the helmsman should not stand with their back to the bow or stern of the yacht. We recommend standing at a 45-degree angle toward the stern. In this position, the helmsman has excellent control over the wheel and throttle, good visibility of the entire stern section, and can see the bow by turning their head.

When moving in reverse:
- Hold the wheel firmly with both hands to prevent it from jerking to an extreme position
- Never accelerate beyond 4 knots in reverse - the load on the steering system is much higher than in forward motion and could damage it
- Remember the yacht has significant inertia (weighing as much as three Indian elephants) and responds to wheel movements with a three-second delay
- Don't continuously work the wheel back and forth - turn it and wait for the yacht's response

#### Practice Exercises

1. Practice stopping the yacht going forward, then reversing:
   - While moving forward, shift to neutral
   - Wait three seconds (to protect the gearbox and propeller)
   - Shift to reverse and increase throttle
   - Monitor speed visually to the side
   - Once the yacht stops and begins moving backward, adopt the reverse steering stance
   - Turn the wheel and observe when the yacht begins to turn, indicating you have control
   - Maintain minimum speed at which the yacht remains responsive

2. Practice turning circles in reverse (first right, then left) and note which direction has a smaller turning radius

3. Practice keeping the yacht on course by selecting a landmark on shore and steering directly toward it

4. Practice stopping near a dock:
   - Approach in reverse at low speed
   - When about one boat length from the dock, shift to neutral
   - As the yacht continues moving (about 3 meters from the dock), shift to forward gear
   - Give a short forward burst to stop completely
   - Keep the wheel straight during the final stop to prevent the stern from swinging

### Docking Procedure

The docking process can be divided into three stages: preparation, approach to the dock, and securing the lines.

#### Preparation

1. Prepare dock lines:
   - Run the line around the stern rail
   - Pass it through the fairlead
   - Secure it to a cleat
   - Coil the remaining line carefully on the stern so it won't fall into the water

2. Hang fenders along the sides:
   - For yachts of similar size, hang fenders with the loop slightly above deck level
   - Place the first pair at the stern quarters
   - Place the second pair at the widest part of the boat
   - Distribute the rest evenly in the after three-quarters of the hull length

3. Brief the crew and assign positions:
   - Position the most agile crew member to handle the windward dock line (they'll be first to go ashore)
   - Position the second crew member with a boat hook on the windward side to catch and secure the mooring
   - Position a third person with a fender on the leeward side as backup

#### Approach Strategy

The approach strategy depends on the marina configuration and the wind strength and direction. For winds up to 15 knots, regardless of direction, the approach trajectory remains the same, differing only in speed - the stronger the wind, the faster the yacht should move to prevent drift.

The general approach is:
1. Enter the alley in reverse, keeping to the opposite side from your target dock (but not too close to avoid hitting moorings of opposite yachts)
2. When passing the gap between neighboring yachts with your stern, turn the wheel toward your berth
3. When the yacht is almost perpendicular to the dock, straighten the wheel
4. As your stern passes the bows of neighboring yachts, shift to neutral
5. After passing the midpoint, shift to forward gear at low speed (keeping the wheel straight)
6. Brake using forward throttle with the wheel straight

For winds over 15 knots, you must consider the wind direction relative to your berth. There are four cases: wind from the stern, bow, starboard, and port.

The easiest docking is with wind from the stern:
- Enter the alley stern-first, staying in the center to avoid being blown onto leeward yachts
- When turning toward your berth, the wind will push the bow and help you turn
- During stopping, the wind will help brake the yacht

For wind from starboard or port, the general rule is to approach your berth stern-to-wind:
- If wind is from port and the entrance is from starboard, simply enter the alley stern-first
- If wind is from starboard (entrance side), the approach changes - it's better to enter the alley bow-first and then reverse to your berth against the wind

The most challenging situation is strong beam winds, which will push against the yacht's side:
- The wind will support the bow and hinder your turn toward the berth
- After turning, it will try to push the bow left or right
- To maintain control, you'll need to keep higher speed almost until the end, stopping very close to the dock

In strong winds, if you doubt your ability to dock safely, look for another berth or request assistance from marina staff. Marina personnel can help you dock safely with special tugboats, even with a broken engine.

#### Securing the Lines

Once you've stopped the yacht one step from the dock:
1. Command the crew member to go ashore and secure the windward dock line
2. Once secured, engage forward gear without waiting for a command
3. The crew member ashore begins pulling in the windward mooring, keeping it away from the yacht to prevent it getting caught in the propeller
4. When the mooring is taut, bring it to the yacht where a crew member catches it with a boat hook
5. Quickly pull in the mooring, making sure it doesn't hang on the fenders and ensuring the slack part doesn't get caught in the propeller
6. Secure the mooring to a cleat (don't strain your back - just take up the slack)
7. With moorings secured, shift to neutral
8. Secure the leeward dock line (making sure it's no shorter than the windward line)
9. Engage forward gear and ease the dock lines to let the yacht move 3-4 meters from the dock
10. Take up any slack in the moorings
11. Engage reverse at high revs - as the yacht moves backward, the moorings hold it while the dock lines loosen
12. Take up this slack in the dock lines and secure them

Only after ensuring both dock lines are securely fastened should you shift to neutral. Otherwise, you risk crushing a crew member's fingers or hand.

If the marina isn't protected from waves, don't tighten the dock lines too much as this may pull out the cleats. Leave some slack, and to prevent the yacht from swinging along the dock and hitting other yachts, set up spring lines like on neighboring yachts.

With docking complete, shut down the engine, set up the gangway, connect the power cable, and take your documents to the marina office to pay for your berth.
