# New Danger Marks

**Back:**
<p>New danger marks indicate newly discovered hazards that may not yet appear on charts or in nautical publications. These marks are temporary and will eventually be replaced by permanent markings after sufficient notice has been given.</p>

<div class="mark-section">
  <h3>New Danger Mark:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Marking method:</strong> Usually marked by duplicate lateral, cardinal, or isolated danger marks</li>
    <li><strong>Additional marking:</strong> May be marked by racon coded Morse "D" (– • •)</li>
    <li><strong>Other methods:</strong> May be marked by other appropriate buoys, light vessels, or Emergency Wreck Marking Buoys</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<p><strong>Important considerations:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>These marks are used until the information about the new danger has been sufficiently publicized</li>
  <li>They may be removed when the appropriate permanent marks have been established</li>
  <li>In urgent situations, they may be placed with very short notice</li>
  <li>Mariners should exercise extreme caution when navigating in areas where new dangers are reported, even if marked</li>
</ul>
