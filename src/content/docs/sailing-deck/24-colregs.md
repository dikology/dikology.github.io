# Rules of the Road (COLREGS)

**Key Terms:**
- **Stand-on vessel:** Vessel that should maintain course and speed
- **Give-way vessel:** Vessel that should take early and substantial action to avoid collision

**Basic Right of Way Rules:**

**Sailing Vessels vs. Motor Vessels:**
- Vessels under sail generally have right of way over power-driven vessels
- Exception: When sailing vessel is overtaking or power vessel is restricted in ability to maneuver

**Between Sailing Vessels:**
- When on different tacks: Vessel on starboard tack is stand-on vessel
- When on same tack: Windward vessel gives way to leeward vessel
- If in doubt which tack another vessel is on: Assume they're on starboard and give way

**Between Power Vessels:**
- Port gives way to starboard (vessel on your right has right of way)
- Overtaking vessel gives way to vessel being overtaken
- Head-on situation: Both vessels alter course to starboard

**Navigation Lights:**
- **Power vessels:** White masthead light, red port light, green starboard light, white stern light
- **Sailing vessels:** Red port light, green starboard light, white stern light (no masthead light)
- **Anchored vessels:** All-round white light

**Sound Signals in Reduced Visibility:**
- **Power vessel underway:** One prolonged blast every 2 minutes
- **Sailing vessel underway:** One prolonged + two short blasts every 2 minutes
- **Anchored vessel:** Rapid ringing of bell for 5 seconds every minute

**Remember:** Rules are no substitute for good seamanship and maintaining proper lookout at all times.
