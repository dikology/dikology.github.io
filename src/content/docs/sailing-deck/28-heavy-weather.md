# Heavy Weather Sailing

**Preparation:**
- Secure all loose items below and on deck
- Don foul weather gear and lifejackets/harnesses
- Brief crew on plans and safety procedures
- Check bilges and ensure pumps are working
- Close hatches and ports
- Rig jacklines for crew safety

**Sail Configuration:**
- Deep reef or storm jib/trysail depending on conditions
- Reduce sail area early rather than late
- Consider storm sails if available (storm jib, trysail)
- Ensure sheets and halyards are secure
- Check all rigging for chafe points

**Strategies by Point of Sail:**

**Beating (Close Hauled):**
- Sail slightly freer than normal close hauled
- Focus on keeping the boat moving through waves
- Ease sheets briefly when hitting large waves
- Consider motor-sailing if making insufficient progress

**Reaching:**
- Often most comfortable point of sail in heavy weather
- Balance heel with reduced sail area
- Steer actively to prevent broaching
- Consider preventers to avoid accidental jibes

**Running:**
- Most dangerous point of sail in heavy weather
- Risk of broaching or accidental jibe
- Consider alternatives: broad reach or heaving to
- If running, use a preventer and consider trailing warps/drogues

**Techniques:**
- **Heaving to:** Creating stable position with backed jib
- **Lying ahull:** (Last resort) Taking down all sails and letting boat lie beam to the waves
- **Running with drogues/sea anchor:** To slow boat and maintain control
- **Active steering:** Keep best crew at helm, rotate frequently to prevent fatigue

**Crew Management:**
- Keep everyone clipped in on deck
- Rotate shifts to prevent exhaustion
- Stay hydrated but limit fluid to reduce need for head use
- Maintain positive attitude and clear communication
- Watch for symptoms of seasickness and hypothermia
