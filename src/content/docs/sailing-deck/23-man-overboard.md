# Man Overboard Recovery

**Immediate Actions:**
1. Shout "MAN OVERBOARD" to alert the crew
2. Assign a crew member as the "spotter" to continuously point at the person in the water
3. Throw flotation devices toward the person
4. Press MOB button on GPS if available
5. Note the position and time

**Recovery Methods:**

**Figure 8 / Williamson Turn:**
- Continue on course for about 5 boat lengths
- Turn sharply to windward and continue until nearly head to wind
- Tack without releasing the jib
- Bear away to a broad reach
- Approach the person from downwind (letting the boat drift toward them)
- Stop the boat alongside the person

**Quick Stop:**
- Immediately turn into the wind
- Tack without releasing the jib
- Allow the backed jib to push the bow down
- Circle back to the person from downwind

**Recovery Tips:**
- Approach at slow speed from downwind
- Stop the boat alongside the person
- Never approach from upwind (risk of drifting over the person)
- Use the engine if necessary
- Have recovery equipment ready (ladder, spare halyard, lifting sling)
- Assign crew to recovery positions before approaching

**Prevention:**
- Always wear lifejackets on deck
- Use harnesses and tethers in rough conditions or at night
- Brief crew on MOB procedures before sailing
- Practice MOB drills regularly
