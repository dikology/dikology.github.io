# Spinnaker Handling

**Types of Spinnakers:**
- **Symmetric Spinnaker:** Traditional balloon-shaped sail with identical halves
- **Asymmetric Spinnaker/Gennaker:** More curved leading edge, ideal for reaching
- **Code Zero:** Flatter spinnaker for close reaching

**Key Spinnaker Lines:**
- **Halyard:** Raises the sail
- **Sheets:** Control the clew(s)
- **Guy/Brace:** Controls the tack on symmetric spinnaker
- **Pole Uphaul/Downhaul:** Adjusts spinnaker pole height
- **Afterguy/Foreguy:** Controls pole fore and aft movement
- **Tack Line:** Adjusts the tack height on asymmetric spinnaker

**Hoisting a Symmetric Spinnaker:**

**Preparation:**
1. Rig pole on mast or deck
2. Attach sheet and guy to clews
3. Attach halyard to head
4. Run pole topping lift and foreguy
5. Prepare spinnaker for launch (in bag or socked)

**Launch Sequence:**
1. Bear away to broad reach/run
2. Set pole height and position
3. Raise halyard quickly and completely
4. Ease sheet to fill sail
5. Trim for optimal shape

**Asymmetric Spinnaker Launch:**
1. Attach tack to bow fitting or bowsprit
2. Attach sheets to clew
3. Attach halyard to head
4. Prepare for launch (in bag or sock)
5. Bear away to desired angle
6. Raise halyard quickly
7. Ease sheet to fill sail

**Gybing Techniques:**

**Symmetric Spinnaker (End-for-End):**
1. Pull in active sheet to center sail
2. Trip pole fitting and swing pole to new side
3. Attach pole to new guy
4. Release old guy and sheet
5. Trim new sheet

**Asymmetric Spinnaker:**
1. Pull in active sheet to stabilize sail
2. Bear away to execute gybe
3. During gybe, ease old sheet and pull in new sheet
4. Trim to proper angle after gybe

**Dousing the Spinnaker:**

**Symmetric:**
1. Head to broad reach
2. Lower pole and secure
3. Pull sail onto foredeck with leeward sheet
4. Lower halyard while controlling sheet

**Asymmetric:**
1. Bear away
2. Gather sail in front of mainsail with sheet
3. Lower halyard while controlling sheet

**Common Problems and Solutions:**
- **Hour-glassing:** Lower partially and retry hoist
- **Wrapping around forestay:** Team on foredeck to unwrap
- **Collapsing:** Adjust pole height and sheet tension
