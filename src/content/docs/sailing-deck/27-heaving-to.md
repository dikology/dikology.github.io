What is Heaving To:
A technique to essentially "park" your sailboat at sea by balancing the forces of your sails and rudder, creating a stable position with minimal forward motion.

**When to Heave To:**
- During heavy weather to reduce strain on the boat and crew
- When needing a break for rest, meals, or boat repairs
- In man overboard situations to stop the boat quickly
- When waiting (for daylight, better weather, or tide change)
- To slow down when approaching a destination too early

**How to Heave To:**

**Basic Method:**
1. Start on a close hauled course
2. Tack the boat without releasing the jib sheet (jib will remain backed)
3. Once through the tack, center or slightly leeward the tiller/wheel
4. Adjust the mainsail to find balance (typically eased)
5. Fine-tune position of all controls until the boat settles

**For Sloop-Rigged Boats:**
- The backed jib pushes the bow away from the wind
- The mainsail and rudder push the stern away from the wind
- These opposing forces create stability with minimal forward motion
- The boat will make slight forward progress while drifting downwind

**Considerations:**
- Different boats will heave to differently (some more effectively than others)
- Creates a "slick" to windward that can help break incoming waves
- Forward speed typically reduces to 1-2 knots
- Practice in moderate conditions before needing it in heavy weather
- May not be effective in very light or extremely heavy winds

**To Resume Sailing:**
1. Return tiller/wheel to center
2. Release the backed jib
3. Trim sails for desired course
4. Resume normal sailing
