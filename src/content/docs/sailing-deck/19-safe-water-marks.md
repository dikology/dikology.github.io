# Safe Water Marks

**Back:**
<p>Safe water marks indicate that there is navigable water all around the mark. They are used to indicate mid-channels, fairways, or landfall positions.</p>

<div class="mark-section">
  <h3>Safe Water Mark:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Color:</strong> Red and white vertical stripes</li>
    <li><strong>Shape:</strong> Spherical, pillar, or spar</li>
    <li><strong>Topmark:</strong> Single red sphere (if fitted)</li>
    <li><strong>Light:</strong> White, showing one of the following rhythms:
      <ul>
        <li>Isophase (equal intervals of light and dark)</li>
        <li>Occulting (more light than dark)</li>
        <li>Long flash (single long flash) every 10 seconds</li>
        <li>Morse code "A" (• —)</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<p>These marks can be passed on either side but are often used to indicate the middle of a shipping channel, so they may be used as a centerline mark to be kept on a specific side depending on the direction of travel.</p>
