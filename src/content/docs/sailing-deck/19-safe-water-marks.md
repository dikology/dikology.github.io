# Safe Water Marks

Safe water marks indicate that there is navigable water all around the mark. They are used to indicate mid-channels, fairways, or landfall positions.

**Safe Water Mark:**
- **Color:** Red and white vertical stripes
- **Shape:** Spherical, pillar, or spar
- **Topmark:** Single red sphere (if fitted)
- **Light:** White, showing one of the following rhythms:
  - Isophase (equal intervals of light and dark)
  - Occulting (more light than dark)
  - Long flash (single long flash) every 10 seconds
  - Morse code "A" (• —)

These marks can be passed on either side but are often used to indicate the middle of a shipping channel, so they may be used as a centerline mark to be kept on a specific side depending on the direction of travel.
