# Docking Techniques

**Back:**
**Preparation:**
- Study wind and current conditions
- Prepare and position fenders
- Ready dock lines (bow, stern, spring lines)
- Brief crew on their roles and communications
- Plan your approach and backup plan
- Consider propeller walk direction (typically to port in reverse for right-hand props)

**Fundamental Concepts:**
- **Pivot Point:** Approximately 1/3 back from bow when moving forward
- **Prop Walk:** Tendency of propeller to push stern sideways in reverse
- **Windage:** Effect of wind on boat, especially when moving slowly
- **Momentum:** Use it deliberately, neutralize it when needed

**Common Docking Scenarios:**

**Alongside Dock (Wind Pushing Away):**
1. Approach at shallow angle (10-20Â°)
2. Slow, controlled speed
3. Step 1: Secure bow line
4. Step 2: Use reverse to bring stern in
5. Step 3: Secure stern line and spring lines

**Alongside Dock (Wind Pushing Toward Dock):**
1. Approach parallel to dock
2. Use wind to gently push boat to dock
3. Be ready to use bursts of forward power and rudder to control drift
4. Secure midship spring line first
5. Use spring line to control position while securing other lines

**Mediterranean Mooring (Stern-to):**
1. Prepare stern lines and bow anchor
2. Approach slowly, bow toward open water
3. Drop anchor at appropriate distance
4. Reverse toward dock, paying out anchor chain
5. Secure stern lines to dock
6. Adjust anchor tension

**Slip Docking:**
1. Approach slowly into the wind/current if possible
2. Center boat in the slip
3. Use brief throttle and rudder adjustments
4. Secure windward side first

**Departing the Dock:**

**Wind Pushing Away:**
1. Leave bow line on as pivot point
2. Release stern and spring lines
3. Use forward gear to move bow out
4. Release bow line

**Wind Pushing Toward Dock:**
1. Use spring line to pivot bow out
2. Short burst of power against spring line
3. Release lines and back out when bow is clear

**Key Tips:**
- Always dock at minimum control speed
- Factor in wind and current effects
- Communication is critical - use hand signals in noisy environments
- Have boat hooks ready to control position
- Don't jump from boat to dock with lines
- Be prepared to abort and try again
- Practice makes perfect - try in open water first
