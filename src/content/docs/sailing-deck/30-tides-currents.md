# Tides and Currents

**Basic Tidal Terms:**
- **High Water (HW):** Maximum height of tide
- **Low Water (LW):** Minimum height of tide
- **Range:** Vertical difference between HW and LW
- **Spring Tides:** Maximum range tides (after full/new moon)
- **Neap Tides:** Minimum range tides (after half moons)
- **Chart Datum:** Reference level for depths on charts (usually lowest astronomical tide)
- **Flood Tide:** Rising tide
- **Ebb Tide:** Falling tide

**Calculating Tidal Heights:**
1. Find primary port in tide tables
2. Note the high and low water times and heights
3. For intermediate times, use rule of twelfths:
   - 1st hour: 1/12 of range
   - 2nd hour: 2/12 of range
   - 3rd hour: 3/12 of range
   - 4th hour: 3/12 of range
   - 5th hour: 2/12 of range
   - 6th hour: 1/12 of range

**Tidal Streams (Currents):**
- Generally strongest at mid-tide
- Typically run parallel to shorelines and channels
- Can be amplified in narrow channels, between islands
- Direction typically reverses approximately at high and low water
- Speed is measured in knots

**Tidal Stream Calculations:**
1. Find tidal diamond or tidal stream atlas for your area
2. Identify the reference time (HW at standard port)
3. Calculate time difference between HW and your planned passage
4. Look up stream direction and speed for that time difference
5. Apply vector to your course and speed

**Navigational Impact:**
- **Depth Considerations:** Actual depth = Chart depth + Tidal height
- **Safe Passage:** Calculate minimum depths at critical points
- **Timing:** Schedule passages through shallow areas near HW
- **Course Planning:** Account for tidal stream effect on course
- **Harbor Entry/Exit:** Be aware of cross-currents at entrances
- **Anchoring:** Allow for tidal range in scope calculations

**Tidal Stream Indicators:**
- Ripples or smooth areas on water surface
- Movement of floating objects
- Changes in boat speed or heading
- Patterns around fixed objects (bridges, buoys)
