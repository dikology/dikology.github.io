# Special Marks

Special marks indicate a special area or feature whose nature may be found by consulting a chart or sailing directions. They are not primarily intended for navigation but indicate special areas or features.

**Special Mark:**
- **Color:** Yellow
- **Shape:** Optional, but not conflicting with navigational marks; often "X"-shaped or pillar
- **Topmark:** Single yellow "X" (if fitted)
- **Light:** Yellow, any rhythm not used for white lights of other marks

**Common uses include:**
- Traffic separation schemes
- Spoil grounds and dredging areas
- Military exercise zones
- Cable or pipeline areas including outfalls
- Recreation zones
- Boundaries of channel crossings
- Areas where anchoring is prohibited
- Fishery or aquaculture areas

Special marks may also be used to mark a channel within a channel (e.g., a preferred route through a wide estuary).
