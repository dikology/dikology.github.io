# Sail Trim Theory

**Back:**
**Basic Concepts:**
- **Angle of Attack:** Angle between the sail and the apparent wind
- **Draft:** The curvature or "belly" of the sail
- **Twist:** Variation in the angle of attack from bottom to top of sail
- **Power:** Amount of force the sail can generate
- **Telltales:** Indicators of airflow around the sail

**Mainsail Controls:**
- **Mainsheet:** Controls angle to the wind and leech tension
- **Boom Vang:** Controls leech tension and twist
- **Outhaul:** Controls draft in the lower part of the sail
- **Cunningham/Downhaul:** Controls draft position and luff tension
- **Traveler:** Controls boom angle while maintaining sheet tension
- **Backstay:** Controls mast bend, affecting sail shape

**Headsail Controls:**
- **Sheet:** Controls angle to the wind and sail shape
- **Fairlead Position:** Controls twist and foot tension
  - Forward: More foot tension, less twist
  - Aft: Less foot tension, more twist
- **Halyard Tension:** Controls luff tension and draft position

**Wind Conditions & Trim Adjustments:**

**Light Wind (0-10 knots):**
- Maximum draft (eased outhaul, eased cunningham)
- Minimal twist (sheet tension)
- Forward jib lead position
- Centerline traveler position

**Medium Wind (10-18 knots):**
- Moderate draft
- Moderate twist
- Centered jib lead position
- Slight traveler drop to leeward

**Strong Wind (18+ knots):**
- Minimum draft (tight outhaul, tight cunningham)
- Maximum twist (eased sheet, tight vang)
- Aft jib lead position
- Traveler dropped to leeward
- Consider reefing before adjusting trim

**Key Indicators:**
- Weather helm indicates too much power in the mainsail
- Lee helm indicates too much power in the headsail
- Flapping telltales indicate incorrect sail trim or angle
