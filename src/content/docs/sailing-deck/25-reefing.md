# Reefing Techniques

**When to Reef:**
- Before you think you need to
- When you first think about reefing
- When wind is consistently above force 4-5 (16-21 knots)
- When inexperienced crew are uncomfortable
- When excessive heel affects boat handling

**Preparations:**
- Ensure reefing lines are clear and ready
- Brief crew on their roles
- Have winch handles ready
- Position the boat on a comfortable point of sail (close reach or beam reach)

**Mainsail Reefing Methods:**

**Slab/Jiffy Reefing:**
1. Head to wind or on a close reach
2. Ease the mainsheet and traveler
3. Tension the topping lift to support boom
4. Lower the halyard to the reefing position
5. Secure the tack cringle to the reefing hook or tack line
6. Tension the reef line to pull clew down and out
7. Secure the halyard
8. Tidy excess sail with reef points or sail ties
9. Ease the topping lift (boom supported by reefed sail)

**In-mast Furling Reefing:**
1. Position boat at close reach 
2. Apply slight tension on the outhaul
3. Ease the sheet slightly
4. Pull the furling line while easing the outhaul
5. Furl to desired amount of sail
6. Retension the outhaul and sheet

**Roller Furling Headsail Reefing:**
1. Ease the headsail sheet slightly
2. Apply slight tension to the sheets to maintain sail shape
3. Pull the furling line smoothly
4. Furl to desired amount of sail
5. Retension the sheet

**Remember:** It's always easier to reef when conditions are moderate than when they've already deteriorated.
