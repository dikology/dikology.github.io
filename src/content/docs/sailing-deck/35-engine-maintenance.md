# Basic Engine Maintenance

**Back:**
**Daily Checks:**
- **Oil Level:** Check before starting (engine cold)
- **Coolant Level:** Check when cold, maintain between min/max marks
- **Belt Tension:** Check for proper tension and wear
- **Raw Water Strainer:** Check for debris and clean if necessary
- **Visual Inspection:** Look for leaks, loose connections, or damage
- **Exhaust Check:** Clear water discharge when running

**Regular Maintenance:**

**Oil and Filter Changes:**
- Change every 100-200 engine hours or annually
- Use manufacturer recommended oil weight
- Replace oil filter with each oil change
- Check for metal particles indicating wear

**Fuel System:**
- Change primary and secondary fuel filters annually
- Drain water separator regularly
- Check fuel lines for cracks or soft spots
- Treat fuel with stabilizer for long-term storage

**Cooling System:**
- Check impeller annually or every 200 hours
- Replace antifreeze every two years
- Clean heat exchanger if overheating
- Inspect raw water intake for blockage
- Check thermostat operation

**Electrical System:**
- Clean battery terminals and connections
- Check alternator belt tension
- Test battery voltage under load
- Inspect starter motor connections
- Spray electrical connections with corrosion inhibitor

**Common Problems and Solutions:**

**Engine Won't Start:**
- Check battery connection and charge
- Verify fuel supply and filters
- Check glow plugs (diesel)
- Inspect starter motor
- Check for air in fuel system (diesel)

**Engine Overheating:**
- Check raw water intake and strainer
- Inspect impeller for damage
- Check coolant level and quality
- Look for blocked heat exchanger
- Verify thermostat operation

**Engine Stalls:**
- Check for dirty fuel filters
- Look for air in fuel system
- Verify idle adjustment
- Check for water in fuel
- Inspect electrical connections

**Excessive Smoke:**
- **Black smoke:** Over-fueling/poor air supply
- **Blue smoke:** Burning oil (worn rings/valve seals)
- **White smoke:** Water in cylinders or cold engine

**Winter Storage Preparation:**
- Change oil and filter
- Add fuel stabilizer
- Change coolant
- Fog cylinders (if recommended)
- Disconnect battery or use maintainer
