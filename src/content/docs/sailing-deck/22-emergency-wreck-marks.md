**Back:**
<p>Emergency Wreck Marking Buoys (EWMB) are used to mark new wrecks or obstructions that pose an immediate danger to navigation. They are deployed as a temporary measure until a more permanent form of marking can be established.</p>

<div class="mark-section">
  <h3>Emergency Wreck Marking Buoy:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Color:</strong> Blue and yellow vertical stripes (equal number, minimum of 4 stripes)</li>
    <li><strong>Shape:</strong> Pillar or spar</li>
    <li><strong>Topmark:</strong> Yellow upright cross (+)</li>
    <li><strong>Light:</strong> Alternating blue and yellow flashing light, 1-second flash (Bl 1.0s + Y 1.0s)</li>
    <li><strong>Range:</strong> Normally visible for at least 4 nautical miles</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<p><strong>Deployment:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Usually placed as soon as possible after a wreck has been discovered</li>
  <li>May be deployed in multiples around the wreck perimeter</li>
  <li>Typically remains in position until:
    <ul>
      <li>The wreck is well known and has been properly published on charts</li>
      <li>The wreck has been fully surveyed and exact position determined</li>
      <li>A permanent marking system has been established</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Mariners should note that these marks are relatively new additions to the IALA system and should pass them at a safe distance.</p>
