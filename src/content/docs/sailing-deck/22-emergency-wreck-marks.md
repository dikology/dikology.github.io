**Back:**
Emergency Wreck Marking Buoys (EWMB) are used to mark new wrecks or obstructions that pose an immediate danger to navigation. They are deployed as a temporary measure until a more permanent form of marking can be established.

**Emergency Wreck Marking Buoy:**
- **Color:** Blue and yellow vertical stripes (equal number, minimum of 4 stripes)
- **Shape:** Pillar or spar
- **Topmark:** Yellow upright cross (+)
- **Light:** Alternating blue and yellow flashing light, 1-second flash (Bl 1.0s + Y 1.0s)
- **Range:** Normally visible for at least 4 nautical miles

**Deployment:**
- Usually placed as soon as possible after a wreck has been discovered
- May be deployed in multiples around the wreck perimeter
- Typically remains in position until:
  - The wreck is well known and has been properly published on charts
  - The wreck has been fully surveyed and exact position determined
  - A permanent marking system has been established

Mariners should note that these marks are relatively new additions to the IALA system and should pass them at a safe distance.
