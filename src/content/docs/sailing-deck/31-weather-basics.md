# Weather Basics

**Back:**
**Key Weather Elements:**
- **Wind:** Direction and speed
- **Pressure:** High/low pressure systems
- **Fronts:** Boundaries between air masses
- **Cloud Types:** Indicators of coming weather
- **Sea State:** Wave height and direction
- **Visibility:** Clear, fog, rain, etc.

**Pressure Systems:**
- **High Pressure (Anticyclone):**
  - Clockwise circulation (Northern Hemisphere)
  - Generally fair weather, light winds
  - Clear skies, but possible fog
  - Slow-moving systems

- **Low Pressure (Depression):**
  - Counter-clockwise circulation (Northern Hemisphere)
  - Associated with clouds, precipitation
  - Stronger winds
  - Faster-moving systems

**Weather Fronts:**
- **Cold Front:**
  - Temperature drops after passage
  - Often brings squalls, heavy rain
  - Wind shifts clockwise (veers)
  - Sharp, defined clouds
  - Quick passage
  
- **Warm Front:**
  - Temperature rises after passage
  - Prolonged light/moderate rain
  - Wind shifts counter-clockwise (backs)
  - Gradual cloud thickening
  - Slower passage

**Cloud Indicators:**
- **Cirrus (high, wispy):** Often precedes a warm front
- **Cumulus (puffy, white):** Fair weather if small, potential storms if large
- **Cumulonimbus (thunderheads):** Thunderstorms, squalls
- **Stratus (gray layers):** Drizzle, poor visibility
- **Nimbostratus (dark, rain layers):** Steady precipitation

**Local Weather Signs:**
- **Wind backing (counter-clockwise):** Weather often deteriorating
- **Wind veering (clockwise):** Weather often improving
- **Rapidly falling pressure:** Storm approaching
- **"Red sky at night, sailor's delight; red sky in morning, sailor's warning"**
- **Halo around sun/moon:** Approaching front with moisture

**Weather Resources:**
- Marine VHF radio forecasts
- NAVTEX broadcasts
- Weather apps with marine forecasts
- Barometer readings and trends
- Visual observation of clouds and horizon
