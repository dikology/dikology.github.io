# Passage Planning

**The Four Stages:**

**1. Appraisal:**
- Gather all relevant information
- Review charts, pilot books, almanacs
- Check weather forecasts and patterns
- Assess crew experience and boat capabilities
- Identify potential hazards and constraints
- Consider tidal conditions and ports of refuge

**2. Planning:**
- Plot the intended route on charts
- Mark waypoints and course legs
- Calculate distances, headings, and estimated times
- Identify navigation features and hazards
- Note tidal gates and stream effects
- Plan fuel and water requirements
- Consider alternate routes and bolt holes

**3. Execution:**
- Brief crew on route, watches, and responsibilities
- Monitor progress against plan
- Record positions regularly
- Maintain situational awareness
- Adapt to changing conditions
- Follow "1 hand for the boat, 1 for yourself"

**4. Monitoring:**
- Continuously assess position versus plan
- Check weather changes against forecast
- Monitor boat systems and crew condition
- Be prepared to modify plan as needed
- Maintain log of positions, weather, and events

**Key Considerations:**

**Navigation:**
- Use multiple position fixing methods
- Allow safety margins around hazards
- Consider leeway and drift in course calculations

**Weather and Timing:**
- Schedule around optimal weather windows
- Plan tidal gate timings
- Allow contingency time

**Safety:**
- Identify safe harbors along route
- Prepare emergency plans
- Establish communication schedules
- Ensure proper safety equipment

**Crew Management:**
- Plan watch schedules
- Organize meal preparation
- Consider seasickness prevention
- Arrange for adequate rest periods

**Documentation:**
- File float plan with responsible person ashore
- Carry appropriate papers for international passages
- Have emergency contacts available
