# Isolated Danger Marks

**Back:**
Isolated danger marks indicate a danger that has navigable water all around it. They are placed on, or near, an isolated danger of limited extent.

**Isolated Danger Mark:**
- **Color:** Black with one or more broad horizontal red bands
- **Shape:** Pillar or spar
- **Topmark:** Two black spheres, one above the other
- **Light:** White flashes in groups of two (2)
- **Mnemonic for light:** "Two spheres, two flashes"

These marks should be passed at a safe distance in any direction, as they indicate a danger surrounded by navigable water. The size of the danger is typically not indicated on navigation charts, so an appropriate safe distance should be maintained.
