# Isolated Danger Marks

**Back:**
<p>Isolated danger marks indicate a danger that has navigable water all around it. They are placed on, or near, an isolated danger of limited extent.</p>

<div class="mark-section">
  <h3>Isolated Danger Mark:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Color:</strong> Black with one or more broad horizontal red bands</li>
    <li><strong>Shape:</strong> Pillar or spar</li>
    <li><strong>Topmark:</strong> Two black spheres, one above the other</li>
    <li><strong>Light:</strong> White flashes in groups of two (2)</li>
    <li><strong>Mnemonic for light:</strong> "Two spheres, two flashes"</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<p>These marks should be passed at a safe distance in any direction, as they indicate a danger surrounded by navigable water. The size of the danger is typically not indicated on navigation charts, so an appropriate safe distance should be maintained.</p>
