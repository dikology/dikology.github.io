# Navigation Basics

**Back:**
**Nautical Charts:**
- **Scale:** Typically 1:10,000 to 1:80,000 for coastal navigation
- **Depths:** Usually shown in meters or fathoms (1 fathom = 6 feet)
- **Heights:** Of land and structures, measured from chart datum
- **Symbols:** Standardized international system for features
- **Compass Rose:** Shows true and magnetic north

**Key Chart Elements:**
- **Buoys and Beacons:** Navigation aids with distinctive colors, shapes, and light patterns
- **Hazards:** Rocks, wrecks, shallow areas
- **Restricted Areas:** Military zones, conservation areas
- **Anchorages:** Designated or recommended areas
- **Contour Lines:** Connect points of equal depth
- **Tidal Information:** Height, direction, and speed

**Basic Navigation Tools:**
- **Dividers/Compass:** For measuring distance and plotting bearings
- **Parallel Rules:** For transferring bearings to compass rose
- **Pencil and Eraser:** For plotting courses
- **Calculator:** For time, speed, and distance calculations
- **Tide Tables:** For determining water depths at specific times

**Position Finding:**
- **Latitude/Longitude:** Primary position coordinates
- **Bearings:** Angular measurement from North (000°) clockwise (e.g., East is 090°)
- **Transit Lines:** Lining up two fixed objects
- **Cross Bearings:** Taking bearings of two or more objects
- **Running Fix:** Single bearing plus dead reckoning

**Course Planning:**
- Plot intended route on chart
- Mark significant waypoints
- Calculate distance, heading, and estimated time
- Note hazards, tide restrictions, and alternative harbors
- Consider leeway and tidal effects on course

**Navigation at Sea:**
- Regularly update position on chart
- Monitor depth against chart expectations
- Use visual landmarks to confirm position
- Maintain log of positions, course, and speed
- Constantly check for hazards ahead
