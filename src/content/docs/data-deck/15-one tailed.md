**Front:** What is the difference between a one-tailed and two-tailed test in hypothesis testing?

**Back:** A one-tailed test looks for an effect in only one direction (either positive or negative), while a two-tailed test looks for an effect in both directions. In a two-tailed test, the significance level (alpha) is split between the two tails.
