**Front:** What does the term \( Z\_{\alpha} \) represent in the sample size formula?

**Back:** \( Z*{\alpha} \) represents the Z critical value for the significance level (alpha), which is the threshold for determining statistical significance. For a two-tailed test with alpha = 0.05, \( Z*{\alpha} = 1.96 \).
