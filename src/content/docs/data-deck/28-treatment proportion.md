**Front:** How do you calculate the treatment proportion (\( P_2 \)) given the baseline proportion (\( P_1 \)) and the MDE?

**Back:** The treatment proportion is calculated as:
\[ P_2 = P_1 \times \left(1 + \frac{\text{MDE}}{100}\right) \]
Where:

- \( P_1 \) is the baseline proportion.
- MDE is the minimum detectable effect in percentage.
