**Front:** What is the difference between MDE (Minimum Detectable Effect) and Delta in the sample size formula?

**Back:** MDE is the relative lift (percentage improvement) from the baseline, while Delta is the absolute difference between the two parameters (e.g., \( \Delta = \theta_2 - \theta_1 \)). Delta squared is used in the sample size formula, not the MDE directly.
