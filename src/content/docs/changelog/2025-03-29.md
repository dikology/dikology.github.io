## New GitHub Workflow

A new workflow file (`.github/workflows/changelog-check.yml`) was added to enforce changelog updates with each PR. This workflow:
- Runs on pull requests
- Checks if any files in the changelog directory were modified
- Fails the check if no changelog updates are found
- Will block merging to main through branch protection rules (as described in the changelog document)

### Configure Branch Protection Rules
1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Navigate to Settings â†’ Branches
3. Under "Branch protection rules", click "Add rule"
4. Set up the following:
   - Branch name pattern: main (or your default branch)
   - Check "Require status checks to pass before merging"
   - Search for and select "changelog-check" in the status checks list
   - Check "Require branches to be up to date before merging"
   - Save changes
